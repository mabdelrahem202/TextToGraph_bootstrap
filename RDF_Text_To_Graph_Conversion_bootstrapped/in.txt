Dear Newspaper, I think that the effects are okay as long as we get off the computers and go outside and see some friends and get some exercise. Computers let us not just talk to each other but it also lets us challenge each other on games without hurting each other it could even stop all ways all at once because we could challenge other countries in war games without killing real living people.
