# TextToGraph_bootstrap
This repository contains the implementation of a novel two-phase unlearnable approach designed to convert text into its semantic graph representation. The method effectively addresses the challenges posed by existing text-to-graph conversion tools, particularly when handling long or complex texts, which often result in fragmented representations.
